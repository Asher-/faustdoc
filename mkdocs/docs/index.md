# Faust Documentation
**A Functional Programming Language for Real Time Signal Processing**

## What is Faust?

[Faust](https://faust.grame.fr) (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing with a strong focus on the design of synthesizers, musical instruments, audio effects, etc. Faust targets high-performance signal processing applications and audio plug-ins for a variety of platforms and standards.It is used on stage for concerts and artistic productions, in education and research, in open source projects as well as in commercial applications.

The core component of Faust is its compiler. It allows us to "translate" any Faust digital signal processing (DSP) specification to a wide range of non-domain specific languages such as C++, C, JAVA, JavaScript, LLVM bit code, WebAssembly, etc. In this regard, Faust can be seen as an alternative to C++ but is much simpler and intuitive to learn.

Thanks to a wrapping system called "architectures", codes generated by Faust can be easily compiled into a wide variety of objects ranging from audio plug-ins to standalone applications or smartphone and web apps, etc.

## Getting Started

### If You’re In a Hurry

If you’re in a hurry and just wanna have a look at how Faust programs look like, you can simply check the examples in the **Examples** tab of the upper menu of this website.

### If You Wanna Get Started With Faust

If you’re looking for a step by step tutorial of approximately 2 hours that will walk you through writing simple Faust programs and give you an overview of what Faust can do, have a look at our [Quick Start Tutorial](manual/quick-start).

### If You’re Looking For the "Manual"

Faust’s syntax and features are thoroughly documented in the **Faust Manual** tab of the upper menu of this website. This resource contains hundreds of code examples and many short tutorials.

### If You’re Looking For the Documentation of a Function In the Faust Libraries

The [documentation of Faust’s standard libraries](https://faustlibraries.grame.fr/) is automatically generated directly from the libraries’ source code.

### If You’re Looking For Tutorials on Various Topics Around Faust

The **Tutorials** tab of the upper menu contains a wide range of tutorials on Faust ranging from using Faust to make audio plug-ins from scratch to designing new architectures for Faust. Similarly, the **Workshops** tab contains the handout of various workshops that were taught around Faust.
