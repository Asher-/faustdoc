# Deploying Faust DSP on the Web

Using developments done for the Web (WebAssembly backends and **libfaust** library compiled in WebAssembly with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)), statically and dynamically Faust generated WebAudio nodes can be easily produced and deployed on the Web. 

See extended documentation[ here](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master-dev/architecture/webaudio).

**Note**: the [faust2cpp2wasm](https://github.com/nuchi/faust2cpp2wasm) tool can possibly be used as a drop in replacement for the wasm file generated by `faust2wasm`, but with Faust's C++ backend instead of its wasm backend.

**Note**: the Faust/Web infrastructure is currently being rewritten in TypeScript in the [wasm2](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/wasm2/javascript) development branch, and will be distributed as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grame/libfaust).
