# Deploying Faust DSP on the Web

Using developments done for the Web (WebAssembly backends and **libfaust** library compiled in WebAssembly with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)), statically and dynamically Faust generated WebAudio nodes can be easily produced and deployed on the Web. See extended documentation[ here](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master-dev/architecture/webaudio).

**Note**: the Faust/Web infrastrucure is currently being rewritten in TypsScript in the [wasm2](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/wasm2/javascript) development branch and will be distributed as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grame/libfaust).
