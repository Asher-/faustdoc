##### [Handling infinity and not-a-number (NaN) values in Faust and C++ audio programming](https://www.dariosanfilippo.com/blog/2020/handling_inf_nan_values_in_faust_and_cpp/)  

This post by [Dario Sanfilippo](https://www.dariosanfilippo.com) discusses insights gained over a few years of audio programming to implement robust Faust/C++ software, particularly when dealing with infinity and NaN values.

##### [Three ways to implement recursive circuits in the Faust language](https://www.dariosanfilippo.com/blog/2020/faust_recursive_circuits/)  

This post by [Dario Sanfilippo](https://www.dariosanfilippo.com) is about the implementation of not-so-simple recursive circuits in the Faust language.
