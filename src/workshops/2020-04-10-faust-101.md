# Faust 101 for the confined

The covid-19 containment offers us at least one excellent opportunity to train! If you've always wanted to get into Faust programming but didn't have the time, here's your chance! 

The objective of this workshop is to familiarize you with the Faust language through very simple examples of sound processing and synthesis. 
The documentation and the examples we will use can be found here : [https://faustdoc.grame.fr](https://faustdoc.grame.fr). All examples will be run in the online Faust IDE [https://faustide.grame.fr](https://faustide.grame.fr). If ever the sounds produced with the IDE are of poor quality, with some clicks, one can use the online editor, which is more rustic, but also lighter [https://fausteditor.grame.fr](https://fausteditor.grame.fr).

## Super simple examples

Let start with super simple examples.

### The simplest Faust program
This is the simplest Faust program imaginable. It contains only one line of code: `process = _;`.

<!-- faust-run -->
```
process = _;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

Several lessons can be learned from this very simple example:

- a Faust program has at least one definition, that of the keyword `process` which indicates the entry point of the program. 
- A definition always ends with a `;`. A common mistake is to forget the semicolon at the end of a definition.
- the `_` sign represents one of the _primitives_ of the language (primitives are the predefined functions of the language). It represents an _audio cable_ that lets the signal pass through without transforming it. This is what one calls in mathematics the _identity_ function, the signal which enters on the left comes out on the right identically. 

Lets try this program using the online Faust IDE...
